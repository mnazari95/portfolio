## Introduction 

This guide is seperated into 3 parts. First we'll be setting up our API Gateway through the AWS console, then we'll 
continue to setup a lambda function, and finally setup an email for Amazon SES so our lambda function can forward the form content 
to our email.

## API Gateway Setup

Lets start off by searching for API Gateway through the aws services. You'll be greeted by the main console page 
and click on the "Create API" button.

<Image src="/apigateway_create_page.PNG" width="400" height="400" layout="responsive" alt="click the 'Build' button for rest api (non-private)"/>

Next page should be similar to the screenshot above. Now choose the REST API type and hit Build.

<Image src="/apigateway_create_api.PNG" width="600" height="400" layout="responsive" alt="click the 'Create API' button"/>

Shortly after you'll see the following page and for this example I named the API 'testAPI' but feel free to name the api related to 
your use case.

<Image src="/apigateway_create_resource.PNG" width="400" height="400" layout="responsive" alt="actions > create resource > create resource name" />

Click on 'Actions' button and select 'create resource' option. Now create a resource name, I've named it 'contact' and finalize it by clicking 
on 'create resource' button. Next step is to create a method for our newly created resource. Select the resource you created in the previous step 
and click on 'Actions' and select 'create method' option, finally confirm it by clicking on the check mark. For this guide I've created a POST method 
that we'll be sending a http request using fetch from our ReactJS frontend.

<Image src="/apigateway_create_method.PNG" width="400" height="400" layout="responsive" alt="setup a CRUD method for your api endpoint" />

If everything is done correctly, you should see the following page. It is important to select 'Mock' for now since we have not yet created 
our Lambda function, now click 'Save' button and navigate back to 'Actions' button and this time we need to do two more steps and we'll be done 
with setting up our API Gateway. 

<Image src="/apigateway_CORS.PNG" width="400" height="400" layout="responsive" alt="enabling CORS for api gateway" />

First lets enable CORS so our frontend http requests don't get denied through fetch. Open the actions menu and 
select 'Enable CORS' and follow the options from the above image and confirm your options.

<Image src="/apigateway_deploy.PNG" width="400" height="220" layout="responsive" alt="api deploy dialog" />

Now for final step for setting up our Gateway is to go back to 'Actions' menu and select 'Deploy API' and give it a stage name and deploy. The following page 
you'll be taken to \[name of stage\] stage editor, here you will simply leave the settings as default and confirm the changes and you're done.

## AWS Lambda

Before we start, navigate to AWS Lambda service from the aws website. Locate the 'Create function' button in 
the top right corner and click it.

<Image src="/lambda_create_fn.PNG" width="400" height="400" layout="responsive" alt="create function config" />

We'll be using NodeJS runtime for this guide. Give a name for your lambda function and under permissions select 
'Create a new role with basic lambda persmissions' then proceed with creating the function.

<Image src="/lambda_create_policy.png" width="400" height="400" layout="responsive" alt="instructions to creating IAM policy" />

Now that we have our lambda function created, we need to go ahead and create a policy to allow us access to SES service 
from our lambda function. Head over to 'simple email service', on the left sidebar select 'policies' then 'Create policy' button. Next page 
you have two ways of making a policy, we'll go with JSON method. Copy the JSON from below and paste it onto the JSON tab. Proceed with 
creation, next page give your policy a name and click create policy, I named it 'EmailPolicy'.

```javascript
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ses:SendEmail",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

<Image src="/lambda_attach_policy.png" width="400" height="150" layout="responsive" alt="finding lambda function role" />

Next we need attach our newly created policy to our lambda function's role. The easiest way to find the role name of 
your lambda function is to head over to lambda services and under permissions tab the first section 'execution role' has 
your role name. After clicking the role name it should open another tab and take you back to IAM services. Under permissions policies 
click on 'attach policies' button and now search for the policy you created on the previous step and attach it to your lambda function role.

```javascript
var AWS = require('aws-sdk');
var ses = new AWS.SES();
 
var RECEIVER = 'your@email.com';
var SENDER = 'your@email.com';

var response = {
 "isBase64Encoded": false,
 "headers": { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'},
 "statusCode": 200,
 "body": "{\"result\": \"Success.\"}"
 };

exports.handler = function (event, context) {
    console.log('Received event:', event);
    sendEmail(event, function (err, data) {
        context.done(err, null);
    });
};
 
function sendEmail (event, done) {
    var params = {
        Destination: {
            ToAddresses: [
                RECEIVER
            ]
        },
        Message: {
            Body: {
                Text: {
                    Data: 'subject: ' + event.subject + '\nemail: ' + event.email + '\ndesc: ' + event.desc,
                    Charset: 'UTF-8'
                }
            },
            Subject: {
                Data: 'Contact Me Form: ' + event.subject,
                Charset: 'UTF-8'
            }
        },
        Source: SENDER
    };
    ses.sendEmail(params, done);
}
```

Copy and paste the code snippet from above onto your lambda's function code and replace the variables 'RECEIVER' & 'SENDER' to 
one email that you would like to receive. Keep in mind that the content that is being passed onto our lambda function are named 
'subject', 'email', and 'desc'. These can be changed to better match your use case. Once you're done with the function code make sure 
to save it by clicking on 'deploy' button.

## Simple Email Service

<Image src="/ses_create_email.png" width="400" height="400" layout="responsive" alt="how to verify email for ses" />

Head over to SES service and follow the instructions from the image above. Verify the email you would like your lambda function to 
forward the content to. Once your email is verified you should see 'verified' under verification status.

## Final Touch Up

We are almost done with this guide, all we need now is to connect our api gateway endpoint to our lambda function. Lets 
head over to API Gateway services, select the api we made earlier and follow the instructions from images below.

<Image src="/apigateway_connect_lambda.png" width="400" height="400" layout="responsive" alt="changing integration request" />

<Image src="/apigateway_connect_lambda_2.png" width="400" height="400" layout="responsive" alt="changing integration request" />

While you're at integration request page, make sure to select the lambda region that your lambda function is located at and search 
the name below it once found hit save. Once we made this change we will need to re-enable CORS for our api and deploy(can be same stage) it. Feel free
to go back in the guide if you've forgotten how to enable CORS or deploy api.

Now what is left is we need to configure our frontend to send the correct parameters 
through POST method to our api endpoint. I have created an simple CRA react app that has the following code, you 
can also download the code from my [github](https://github.com/mnazari95/form-lambda-test) which might be easier and just change URL variable to your specific API Gateway 
endpoint.

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {

  const [subject, setSubject] = useState("");
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
  const [message, setMessage] = useState("");
  const URL = 'YOUR API ENDPOINT';

  const handleInput = (input) => {

		switch (input.target.name) {
			case "email":
				setEmail(input.target.value);
				break;
			case "subject":
				setSubject(input.target.value);
				break;
			case "message":
				setMessage(input.target.value);
				break;
		}
  }
  
  const handleRequest = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    const data = {
      subject,
      email,
      desc: message
    };

    const options = {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(data)
    };

    fetch(URL, options)
      .then(() => {
        console.log('form was sent');
      })
      .catch(err => console.log(err));
  }
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h2>Contact Form</h2>
      <form>
        <label htmlFor="subject">Subject</label>
        <input type="text" name="subject" onChange={handleInput}/>
        <label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
        <input type="email" name="email" onChange={handleInput}/>
        <label htmlFor="message">Message</label>
        <textarea name="message" onChange={handleInput}/>
        <input type="submit" onClick={handleRequest} />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

If you have managed to follow all of the steps correctly, you should be able to receive the data you enter 
in the react app to appear in your email.
